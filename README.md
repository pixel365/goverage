# Goverage – Inline Go Code Coverage Hints

**Goverage** is a JetBrains IDE plugin that displays inline code coverage for Go files based on the `go test -coverprofile` report.  
It supports **GoLand**, **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate**, and any JetBrains IDE with the Go plugin.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **File-level coverage**: shown above the `package` line.
- ✅ **Function-level coverage**: shown above each `func` declaration.
- ✅ Parses `coverage.out` generated by `go test -coverpkg=./... -coverprofile=coverage.out`.
- ✅ Updates automatically when the file or coverage profile changes.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository and build the plugin:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean buildPlugin
    ```

2. In your JetBrains IDE:
   - Go to **Settings → Plugins → ⚙️ → Install Plugin from Disk**.
   - Select the `.zip` file from `build/distributions`.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Generate a coverage profile in the root of your Go module:

    ```bash
    go test -coverpkg=./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
    ```

2. Open any `.go` file in your project.

3. You’ll see inline hints like:

    ```
    File Coverage: 91.75%
    Function Coverage: 85.00%
    ```

## 🛠️ Notes

- Coverage is resolved using the path format used in `coverage.out`, which typically looks like:  
  `github.com/your/module/pkg/file.go`
- The plugin reads the `go.mod` file to determine the module name.
- Only works with monorepos if `go test` and `coverage.out` are executed per-module.
